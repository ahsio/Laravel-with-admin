## Laravel 4.2 PHP Framework with SB Admin Dash

You're using Laravel several times? Here's a Boilerplate, it includes:

* [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) of course :)

* [Laravel-widgets](https://github.com/Arrilot/laravel-widgets), like WordPress widgets or Joomla modules.

* [Way generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators)

* [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) to populate the database.

* [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) for icons.

* [SB Admin](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/), free and includes a lot of UI elements. I've changed some colors, fonts ..etc, and I included less of Bootstrap, here is my [repo](https://github.com/kossa/startbootstrap-sb-admin)

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/kossa/Laravel-with-admin)
2. Run : `composer install`, et Voil√†! ^^
